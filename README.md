# Transcript Attestation

A Move-based smart contract project that enables universities and institutions to issue and verify transcript attestations on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring authenticity, immutability, and seamless verification for students and employers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Verification**: Secure transcript attestation without intermediaries
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain-based storage ensures tamper-proof documents
- **Easy Verification**: Quick verification process for employers and institutions
- **Student Privacy**: Students control access to their verified credentials
- **Institution Trust**: Only authorized institutions can attest transcripts

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of Move smart contracts deployed on the Aptos blockchain that handle:

- Transcript attestation by authorized institutions
- Secure storage of transcript hashes and metadata
- Verification mechanisms for third parties
- Student data privacy and access control

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

- [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli) installed
- [Move language](https://move-language.github.io/move/) development environment
- Node.js (v14 or higher) for any frontend components
- Git for version control

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakshiU-21/Test.git
cd Test
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
aptos init
```

### 3. Compile the Contract
```bash
aptos move compile
```

### 4. Deploy to Testnet
```bash
aptos move publish --profile testnet
```

## 🔧 Usage

### For Institutions

#### Attest a Student Transcript
```move
public entry fun attest_transcript(
    institution: &signer,
    student_address: address,
    institution_name: String,
    transcript_hash: String,
    grade: String,
    attestation_date: u64
)
```

### For Verification

#### Verify a Transcript
```move
public fun verify_transcript(student_address: address): (String, String, String, u64, bool)
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
aptos move test
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Transcript attestation functionality
- ✅ Verification mechanisms
- ✅ Error handling for edge cases
- ✅ Access control validation

## 🚦 API Reference

### Core Functions

| Function | Description | Parameters |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `attest_transcript` | Attest a student's transcript | institution, student_address, institution_name, transcript_hash, grade, attestation_date |
| `verify_transcript` | Verify and retrieve transcript data | student_address |

### Data Structures

#### Transcript
```move
struct Transcript has store, key {
    student_address: address,
    institution: String,
    transcript_hash: String,
    grade: String,
    attestation_date: u64,
    is_verified: bool,
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Hash Verification**: Transcript documents are stored as cryptographic hashes
- **Access Control**: Only authorized institutions can attest transcripts
- **Immutability**: Once attested, transcript records cannot be modified
- **Privacy**: Personal data is minimized and hashed where possible
